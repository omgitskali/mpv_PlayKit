Go to the [**📖Wiki Section📖**](../../wiki) above to view the documentation navigation and descriptions of the files in the subdirectories

For custom requirements, it is recommended to modify the original file. If creating a new text file separately, ensure the encoding is **UTF-8** and the line endings are **LF**, otherwise mpv may fail to recognize it
